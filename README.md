### This challenge teaches several important security concepts:

- How Move handles access control and ownership verification
- Resource account management and signer capabilities
- APT (Aptos Coin) integration and transfer security
- Randomness implementation using `#[randomness]` attribute
- State management with global storage and tables
- Economic logic verification (airdrop mechanics)
- Balance tracking consistency (internal vs actual balances)
- Prevention of double-spending and multiple claims
